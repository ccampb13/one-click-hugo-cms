### A PIONEER OF COFFEE

Our story starts with James Folger who, at the age of 14, traveled to San Francisco. He and his two brothers came from Nantucket in search of gold after a major fire destroyed their family's livelihood. While his brothers left for the mines, James stayed behind and got a job with The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. 

### BUILDING A BUSINESS OF INTEGRITY

James became a full partner of the The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. But, following the Civil War, the economy collapsed - resulting in the business going bankrupt. He convinced his creditors to pay off the company's debts, and then bought out all the other partners, renaming the company J.A. Folger & Co.
